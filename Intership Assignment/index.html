            <h1>PREMANU FOUNDATION</h1>
            <h4>A Step Towards Humanity</h4>
            <p>Premanu Foundation, established in 2019 by two students from TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences), is a rapidly growing non-profit organization driven by a noble mission and unwavering commitment to child rights. In a remarkably short span of time, the organisation has made a significant impact, positively transforming the lives of over 29,000 children. While currently active in five states, our aspirations transcend geographical boundaries as we envision a future where our efforts know no bounds.
                <br>
            We recognize children as the torchbearers of our civilization, deserving guidance towards a life brimming with possibilities and opportunities. Our primary focus lies in holistic child development, and to achieve this, we actively collaborate with governmental entities and local communities. By forging strong partnerships with these stakeholders, we work tirelessly to create an ecosystem that empowers children to thrive and reach their full potential.
            <br>
            Driven by our unwavering passion, Premanu Foundation has experienced remarkable growth over the past four years. However, we acknowledge that our impact can only be magnified through the collective efforts of society. We earnestly appeal to individuals from all walks of life to embrace their responsibility towards these young lives and join us in making a meaningful difference.
            <br>
            As Premanu Foundation continues to forge ahead, we wholeheartedly invite like-minded individuals, organizations, and philanthropists to join forces with us. Together, we can create a powerful and lasting impact on the lives of countless children. Join us on this transformative journey as we foster a world where every child's rights are respected, protected, and nurtured.</p>
